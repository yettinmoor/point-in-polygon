# Point in polygon algorithm

This algorithm computes whether a given point in Cartesian space is inside or outside a given polygon. I wrote it as an exercise and make no claims to efficiency or elegance.

The algorithm tests the total rotation of the polygon's vertices around the point, i.e. 2Ï€ * the [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number).

## Example map

To test the algorithm, I used a simple ASCII text file and wrote a function to import it as a list of `[x, y]` coords.

I test the algorithm against the points labeled `a`, `b`, etc.

Note that no vertices are on the edge of the map in order to avoid tedious out-of-bounds checking.
